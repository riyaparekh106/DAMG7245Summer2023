I want to get into the hobby by designing aero automotive parts such as fender flares, custom gauge and switch pods, lips etc. I've never taken a CAD course but I would say I'm proficient enough with computers as I work as a developer. My uncle is an architect and it seems like autocad might be something good to go with. What are some other good alternatives that allow accurate modeling down to millimeters and possibly breaking larger objects into smaller 3d printable pieces to mash together? </p>
",What is a good software for designing car parts,<3d-design>,"<p>You've avoided a number of attributes of a poor question by specifying your objective in detail, while also providing some indication of your experience. AutoCAD is not well known as being 3d printer friendly, although a skilled AutoCAD design user may be able to create acceptable models.</p>

<p>One could consider more organic modeling software such as Blender, although it works in reverse of my comment above. It's great for free-form model building but not so much for engineering type construction. Again, a competent Blender user can avail himself of the parametric aspects of the software, but it's more work than one would necessarily desire to engage.</p>

<p>SolidWorks has a number of followers in the 3d modeling community. My experience with the software has shown me that it can be learned fairly quickly and is powerful enough to allow one to explode creatively over time.</p>

<p>The structure of Solidworks workflow fits in directly with your description, both to the reference to accurate modeling as well as the break-apart aspect. The construction of a model in SW is done via sketches and various actions performed on resultant objects created from those sketches. It's not free software, rather pricey, but it may also save you so much work as to pay for itself over time.</p>

<p>There are other options, of course, some of which are free to students and hobbyists. I did a quick Google search for ""free parametric 3d modeling software"" which resulted in this link:</p>

<p>For the shape you show here, the simplest approach for anyone with modeling experience is maybe to just draw it from scratch (with a few key dimensions). Your shape is only made up of a handful of primitive shapes.</p>

Create only one-half of the nose cone curve and maintain a ""standard"" axis reference, say, using the Y-axis as the rotation point.</p>

<pre><code>In the Sculpt workspace, choose Create Revolve.
Select the profile to revolve.
In the Revolve dialog:
    Click Axis and then select the axis to revolve around.
    Choose Full or Angle to specify whether the revolution is full or to a specific angle.
    For Direction choose One Side, Two Side or Symmetrical.
    For Symmetry, choose None or Circular.
</code></pre>

<p>The above text is taken directly from the link. The specific web site also includes a Flash video of the steps involved.</p>

<p>If thickness is required for your creation, consider to draw the sketch from the nose to the base, then use Offset or hand sketch in a parallel line that returns to the nose. Ensure the base segment is joined and that the nose segments are open and are aligned to the Y-axis.</p>

<p>As the sketch is revolved, the nose sections will ""close"" while the base creates the closure necessary to make a solid that is hollow within and open at the bottom.</p>

<p>A gasket made of rubber or other elastic or deformable material is probably the best option. Printing one or both of the parts using a deformable material like TPU might also work. Finally, if you don't need to open the unit during the experiment, you could use a sealant like silicone caulk might make sense.</p>

Designing the foundations of mini-houses isn't difficult.  However the foundation of a full-size house is different; the larger the more difficult.  The one piece nature of a 3D-printed house makes it almost impossible to repair if the foundation shifts.  Foundation repair is the largest home maintenance cost of existing houses.  Thus, the designs of most existing house foundations are not adequate.</p>
<p>Usually the form for the foundation is printed, rebar is placed in the form, and the foundation poured.  Piers seem to be a most.  While shims can be added or altered on piers with pier and beam, unless the beams hold the house ridge (minimum flexing), this doesn't appear to be an option.  What are adequate designs for 3D printed houses?</p>
<p>Family dwellings in the U.S. usually run from 1,100 to 3000 sq.ft. (aprox. 100 to 280 sq.meters).  More common is 1500 to 2000 sq.ft. (aprox. 140 to 190 sq.meters).  Ceilings are at least 8 ft. (2.44 meters) high.</p>
<p>We can speculate, but a good answer would reference actual construction.  Some speculation:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Print individual wall panels on a bed flat on the ground similar to how warehouses are constructed out of wall panels.  Thus, eliminate the one piece.</p>
</li>
<li><p>One could make concrete pier and beams in a grid pattern within the slap.  The beams would need to be ridged enough to keep the house from flexing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Structures built as transportable units would survive a shifting foundation and thus be reparable.</p>

I cannot seem to find any guide to how magnets are used for 3d printing at various strengths and I cannot afford to buy too many types that I am not then going to use.</p>
<p>Any help that you can provide will be greatly appreciated.</p>
",How Do I Determine The Appropriate Magnet Strength For A Tight Seal On A Box,<3d-design>,"<p>You can vary the âstrengthâ of the magnet by making a membrane of 3D printed plastic in between the magnets. The strength of the attraction is something like a logarithmic relationship to distance- small changes in thickness of material in between the magnets have a large effect on how strong they stick to each other. You could dial in your print by buying strong rare earth magnets and experimenting with attenuating the strength with the membrane. Could even use sheets of paper to get the right feel, then measure the thickness of the stack.</p>
<p>If using an fdm printer, it could be helpful to insert the magnets with a pause in the printing, and print over the top, if there isnât a good way to otherwise capture them.</p>

I'm planning to 3D print the plastic piece with nylon (must be nylon for biocompatibility), but the tolerances won't be sufficient to ensure a consistent press-fit for the pin. To get around this, I plan to undersize the hole, and then ream it out with a reamer on the drill press. There will be 1000 pieces on this run. Any flaws you can see with this design?</p>
",Inserting steel dowel pin into hole with interference fit,<3d-design>,"<p>It is not possible to insert a steel dowel into a hole of a plastic workpiece with a press fit: at least not for long.

<p>If someone were making a commercial device with this and designing a case, how would they mount this? We obviously see the 4 screw holes at the corners, but if you looked at this device from the side, you'll notice the glass is only about 1.2Â mm proud of the PCB. In addition, if you solder headers to the 4 terminals, which is the common use, the end of the headers are actually flush with the glass.</p>
<p>Should the screws be coming through the case from the outside, through the PCB holes, with a nut on the other side? Would the glass normally be covered with acrylic rather than flush with the outside of the case?</p>
